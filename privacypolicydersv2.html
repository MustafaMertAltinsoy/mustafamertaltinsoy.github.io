    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p class="muted">Last updated: October 16, 2025</p>

    <p>This Privacy Policy describes how <strong>Romerto</strong> ("we", "our", or "us") collects, uses, and shares information when you use the mobile application <strong>Ders Takip-Ajanda Uygulaması 2</strong> (the “App”). By installing or using the App you agree to the collection and use of information as described in this Policy.</p>

    <h2>1. Data We Collect</h2>
    <p><strong>Permissions & device access</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Notifications</strong> — The App requests permission only to send push notifications. We do not collect notification content from your device.</li>
    </ul>

    <p class="note"><strong>Important:</strong> The App itself stores user data locally on the device (see <em>Data Storage</em> below). The App does not request or store personal information such as name, email, phone number, or location on our servers.</p>

    <h2>2. Third-Party Services</h2>
    <p>We use third-party services to provide analytics and monetization. These services may collect information about your device and how you use the App. The third parties we use are:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Google AdMob</strong> — used to display ads. Ad networks may collect device identifiers and other usage information to serve and personalize ads.</li>
      <li><strong>Firebase Analytics</strong> — used to understand app usage and performance. Firebase may collect anonymous usage events, device information (e.g., OS version, device model), and app crash reports.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>We do not control these third parties’ data collection practices. Please review their privacy policies for details about what information they collect and how to opt out of personalized advertising or analytics.</p>

    <h2>3. Data Storage & Retention</h2>
    <p><strong>Local storage (Hive)</strong></p>
    <p>All user data created by the App (notes, tasks, schedule entries, and any other App data) is stored locally on the user’s device using Hive. We do not back up or transmit this user data to our servers by default.</p>

    <p><strong>Retention</strong> — Data remains on the device until the user deletes the App or removes data via the App (if such an in-App delete feature exists). Uninstalling the App removes local data from the device according to the device's behavior and the Hive storage lifecycle.</p>

    <h2>4. Data Deletion</h2>
    <p>If you want your App data removed, uninstall the App from your device. Because data is stored locally (Hive), uninstalling the App is the primary way to remove stored data. If you need additional assistance, contact us at the email below and we will advise on available options; note that because data is stored only on the device, we cannot delete data from a device we do not have access to.</p>

    <h2>5. Children</h2>
    <p>The App is suitable for general use. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under the age of 13. If a parent or guardian believes that their child under 13 has provided personal information through the App, please contact us using the email address below so we can take appropriate action.</p>

    <h2>6. How We Use Collected Information</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>To send push notifications (with your permission).</li>
      <li>To analyze application usage and crashes via Firebase Analytics to improve the App.</li>
      <li>To deliver advertisements through AdMob; ad providers may use device identifiers for ad personalization.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>7. Data Sharing</h2>
    <p>We do not sell personal information. We may share aggregated or anonymized usage data with service providers (e.g., analytics and ad networks) to operate the App and display ads. Those providers may collect and process data as described in their own policies.</p>

    <h2>8. Security</h2>
    <p>We take reasonable steps to protect data stored locally in the App. However, no method of storage or transmission is completely secure. We cannot guarantee absolute security of data stored on user devices.</p>

    <h2>9. International Transfers</h2>
    <p>The App stores data locally on the device. Data processed by third-party services (e.g., Firebase, AdMob) may be transferred to and processed in countries outside your own. Those services maintain their own safeguards and privacy controls.</p>

    <h2>10. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
    <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. When we make material changes, we will update the “Last updated” date at the top of this page. Continued use of the App after changes constitutes acceptance of the updated Policy.</p>

    <h2>11. Contact</h2>
    <p>If you have questions, requests, or concerns about this Privacy Policy or about handling of data related to the App, contact:</p>
